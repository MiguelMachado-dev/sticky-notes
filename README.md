# Sticky Notes

## The project

Sticky Notes is a React application to create and play around with sticky notes.

With this solution you can drag each note, resize the text field and delete the note by moving it to top left or clicking in the X button. You can also change the order of the note, bringing it to the front. All notes will be saved to local storage and restored on page load.

```bash
$ npm install # with NPM
